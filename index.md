# Welcome to the Children's Health Game Official Website



#### *Created by Michael Graves and Ryan Gaulding using Godot.*

###Why We Created This Game
We created this game to provide an avenue for healthcare professionals to more easily and reliable spread important messages to the youths. 

The old way of handing out sheets of paper and having them read is no more, with this solution children can do what they do best, play video games, while at the same time getting important health facts to improve their lives.


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nsx00/ChildrensHealthGame/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
